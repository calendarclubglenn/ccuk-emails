      <p>Hi there,</p>
      <p>You are receiving this email because you have opted-in, at some point in the past, to receiving our weekly emails - perhaps when placing an order with us or via a signup form on the website.</p>
      <p>Let us get straight to the point: because of the law change on 25 May 2018 (this Friday) we want to let you know more about how we collect, store and process your personal information; we want to be totally transparent with you and we want to make sure you know your rights with regards to your control over your information held by us.</p>
      <p>Among other things, our updated <a href="https://calendarclubuk.groovehq.com/knowledge_base/topics/cc-privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> includes details on the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What personal information we collect and store as you engage with us</li>
        <li>Your right to access any personal information we may store about you</li>
        <li>Your right to be informed about how we process your personal information</li>
        <li>How we share your data with our partners to give you the best service possible</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This new policy provides you with more transparency on how we collect, store and process your personal information but we will continue to handle your information in the same careful and secure way we have always handled it.</p>
      <p>Finally, you will <strong>always</strong> have the ability to opt-out, at any time, to receiving marketing emails by clicking the unsubscribe link on every marketing email you receive from us - there is one below if you need to use it now. If you have any questions, please email us using the details on the <a href="https://calendarclubuk.groovehq.com/knowledge_base/topics/cc-privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> page. Otherwise, to continue receiving our marketing emails, no further action is required. Thank you.</p>
