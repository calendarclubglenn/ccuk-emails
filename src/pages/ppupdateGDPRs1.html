      <p>Hi,</p>
      <p>You are receiving this email because you have opted-in to receiving our weekly emails at some point in the past - perhaps when placing an order with us or via a signup form on the website.</p>
      <p>Let us get straight to the point: because of the law change on 25 May 2018 (this Friday) we want to let you know more about how we collect, store and process your personal information; we want to be totally transparent with you and we want to make sure you know your rights with regards to your control over your information held by us.</p>
      <p>Our updated <a href="https://calendarclubuk.groovehq.com/knowledge_base/topics/cc-privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> describes, in plain English, how we process your information based on &quot;Legitimate Interests&quot;. This means that as we conduct and manage our business, we assess the potential impact (whether positive or negative) that our processing of your information, and our marketing activity based on that information, may have on you balanced against the benefit to both you and our business.</p>
      <p>For example, we have an interest in ensuring that our marketing activity is as relevant as possible for you to help you decide whether to buy from us. So, we may process your information to personalise the marketing messages which we show you, and send to you in email form - including product recommendations - making the processing of your information in your interests as well as ours.</p>
      <p>Please read our updated <a href="https://calendarclubuk.groovehq.com/knowledge_base/topics/cc-privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> for more information on how we process your information as well as your rights, including your right to object to any information processing, under the new GDPR legislation.</p>
      <p>Finally, you will ALWAYS have the ability to opt-out, at any time, to receiving marketing emails by clicking the unsubscribe link on every marketing email you receive from us - there is one below if you need to use it now! If you have any questions, please email us using the details on the <a href="https://calendarclubuk.groovehq.com/knowledge_base/topics/cc-privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> page. Otherwise, to continue receiving our marketing emails, no further action is required. Thank you.</p>
